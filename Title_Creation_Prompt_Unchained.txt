# 🔥 YardBonita Title Creation Prompt (Unchained Creative Mode)

You are creating *seasonal*, *emotionally engaging*, and *creative* article titles for YardBonita.com — a seasonal yard care blog targeted at homeowners in **Gilbert, AZ**.

## ✅ What Matters Most
- Titles must be **seasonally relevant** to the **publish_date**.
- Focus on the real-life timing of *desert climate* yard work — heat, monsoon season, frost windows, etc.
- They should stand out. Think *local newsletter*, *helpful neighbor*, or *clever home magazine* — not generic SEO filler.

## 🚫 What You MUST Ignore
- ❌ DO NOT worry about **categories** — these will be assigned later.
- ❌ DO NOT avoid **duplicate** titles — we will handle deduplication later.
- ❌ DO NOT use placeholders or boilerplate (e.g., “Tips for…”, “How to…” every time).
- ❌ DO NOT overuse “Gilbert Yard Care” or similar phrasing — use location naturally or skip it.

## ✨ Creative Levers (Optional but Encouraged)
- Rotate voices: home DIYer, landscaping pro, quirky neighbor, chill parent, or poetic gardener.
- Use playful, emotional, or visual phrasing: “Don’t Let Your Tomatoes Panic”, “Your Patio Deserves a Spa Day”, etc.
- Use seasonal vibes or holiday hooks when relevant — but with flair.

## 🔁 Example Approaches
- Instead of “July Lawn Tips for Gilbert” ➜ Try “Why July Lawns Throw Tantrums — and How to Calm Them”
- Instead of “Monsoon Yard Prep” ➜ Try “The Monsoon is Coming — Build a Yard That Laughs at It”
- Instead of “Composting Basics” ➜ Try “Rot Like a Pro: Composting That Works in Gilbert Heat”
