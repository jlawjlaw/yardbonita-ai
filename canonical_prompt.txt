✍️ Article Body Instructions

Your job is to write a rich, detailed, and helpful article that exceeds expectations.

🚫 The article must not begin with an <h2> or any heading. Always start with a brief introductory <p> paragraph to introduce the topic naturally before any section headings. This is mandatory for visual and SEO consistency across YardBonita.

Continue the article using structured HTML (<h2>, <p>, <ul>, etc.) with no use of <h1> tags.

⸻

✅ Section Instructions
	•	Organize the article into clear, helpful sections with 2–3 full paragraphs each.
	•	Do not use outline bullets as section titles. Instead, create original, human-sounding section headings that reflect the actual content and match the local tone.
	•	Feel free to combine, reorder, or enrich sections if it improves flow or clarity.

⸻

📏 Article Depth Requirements

This article must be a comprehensive, deeply detailed guide with lasting value. You must write **at least 1800 words**.

You may not stop early or summarize. If the article is under 1800 words, expand each section with more local insight, examples, or add additional sections. This requirement is absolute.

You are responsible for meeting or exceeding the 1800-word requirement. Do not underdeliver. If the article is too short, you must expand the content meaningfully by:
	•	Deepening each section with more local detail
	•	Adding relevant examples or step-by-step tips
	•	Introducing additional helpful sections if needed

🚫 You may not end early or summarize. Do not use phrases like:
	•	“In conclusion”
	•	“To wrap up”
	•	“With these tips…”

You must deliver a complete, richly informative Tier 1 article. Every section should serve a purpose and add value. If a section feels thin or generic, rewrite it.

✅ Your final output will be rejected unless it fully meets:
	•	Tier 1 word count (≥1800)
	•	Local specificity
	•	Practical, helpful detail
	•	SEO quality

⸻

✅ 🧪 Mandatory Final QA: Do Not Submit Without This

Before submitting your article, you must perform a full quality check. Never return a draft. Only submit polished, Tier-compliant articles that meet all criteria below:

1. ✅ Word Count & Depth
	•	Tier 1: 1800+ words
	•	Tier 2: 1400–1600 words
	•	Tier 3: 1100–1300 words

⛔ If you’re under word count, do not pad. Instead:
	•	Expand underdeveloped sections
	•	Add specific local tips, examples, or context
	•	Improve flow and clarity

2. ✅ Structural Quality
	•	Each <h2> section must include 2–3 full paragraphs
	•	Never open with <h2> — always begin with a short intro <p>
	•	No conclusions or wrap-up phrases (e.g., “In conclusion”)

3. ✅ SEO & Tagging
	•	Focus keyphrase must appear naturally in:
	•	Intro paragraph
	•	At least one <h2> heading
	•	Final paragraph
	•	SEO title: Max 60 characters. Simple and direct.
	•	Meta description: Max 155 characters. Clear benefit to reader.
	•	Tags: 3–5 specific, high-relevance keywords (no generalities)

4. ✅ Internal Links
	•	Use provided internal links naturally in the body
	•	Do not add a “Related Articles” section (handled by system)

5. ✅ Submit Only When Ready
	•	If any section is too short, too generic, or missing key info, revise it.
	•	This is a live site. Every article must be ready to publish.

🎨 Persona and Flair Instructions

(Will be dynamically replaced by the system using the author persona and selected flair types.)

Author Attribution Rule
You may not quote or refer to the author as themselves.
Do not write lines like “As [Author Name] says…” or “According to [Author]…”
Use anonymous or third-party framing instead:
– “One local expert recommends…”
– “A Gilbert landscaper might suggest…”
– “Pros in the area say…”

Write in the voice, tone, and style of the assigned author using their persona and flair. All guidance must sound natural and human. If no flair styles are provided, write cleanly and clearly.

⸻

🖼️ Image Metadata Instructions

You do not need to insert the <figure> block. The system will automatically place it.

You must generate metadata for an image that matches the content of the article:
	•	image_filename: A short, meaningful .png filename
	•	image_alt_text: A concise functional description (≤125 characters)
	•	image_caption: A friendly, inviting sentence (≤160 characters)
	•	image_prompt: A richly detailed, realistic visual description (25–45 words)

The image_prompt must describe a **realistic, local scene** based on the article body. It should reflect:
	• The correct **season**, **location**, and **topic**
	• **Visible features** like plants, materials, tools, light, people, or layout
	• A clear **point of view** (e.g., close-up, wide shot, overhead, etc.)

Do not invent visuals that aren’t grounded in the article body.

⸻

📎 Internal Linking

You will be provided a list of internal links from the same city and category. 
Use these for context and inspiration.

If you mention any of the provided article titles in your writing, use their exact titles in plain text.
❌ Do NOT manually insert <a> tags or use href="#" placeholders.
✅ DO write the exact article title in the body naturally — our system will automatically convert it to a link after generation.

⚠️ Do not add a “Related Articles” section — the system will insert it automatically at the end.

⸻

🧠 SEO Best Practices

You must write optimized SEO metadata that stays within strict character limits:
	•	seo_title: Max 60 characters. Must include the city and topic. No fluff. Use simple, direct phrasing.
	•	seo_description: Max 155 characters. Make it compelling and benefit-driven. Focus on what the reader gains, not a summary.

You must self-enforce these limits by counting characters and rewriting if needed. Do not return longer values — write concise and optimized from the start.

Examples:
❌ Too long: “Discover how to transform your yard with these helpful Chandler gardening tips for the spring season.”
✅ Good: “Spring Gardening Tips for Chandler Yards”

❌ Too long: “In this article, we cover the best methods to control pests in Queen Creek backyards.”
✅ Good: “Keep Queen Creek pests away with smart outdoor tips”
