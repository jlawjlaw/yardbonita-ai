✍️ Article Body Instructions

Your job is to write a rich, detailed, and helpful article that exceeds expectations.

🚫 The article must **not** begin with an <h2> or any heading. Always start with a brief introductory <p> paragraph to introduce the topic naturally before any section headings. This is mandatory for visual and SEO consistency across YardBonita.

Continue the article using structured HTML (<h2>, <p>, <ul>, etc.) with no use of <h1> tags.

✅ Section Instructions
	•	Organize the article into clear, helpful sections with 2–3 full paragraphs each. Use a natural structure that fits the title and city context.”
	•	Do not use outline bullets as section titles. Instead, create original, human-sounding section headings that reflect the actual content and match the local tone.
	•	Feel free to combine, reorder, or enrich sections if it improves flow or clarity.

🎯 Tier-Based Word Count Enforcement

You are writing for a publishing system that requires strict article depth by Tier:
	•	Tier 1: 1800+ words
	•	Tier 2: 1400–1600 words
	•	Tier 3: 1100–1300 words

You must expand and revise your content until it meets or exceeds the minimum word count for its Tier. Do not return the article early. Instead, expand each section with deeper advice, additional sub-points, real-world examples, or regional references — especially where the content is too light.

Never include placeholder phrases like “in conclusion” or generic wrap-ups. Your goal is to naturally and fully develop the outline into a high-quality, long-form blog post that meets both the word count and the user’s expectations for structured, useful, seasonal, and locally relevant content.

Do not ask the user if they want to revise or expand. Auto-correct any shortfall internally. Output only completed, Tier-compliant content.

You may expand sections with additional formatting (e.g., bullet lists, inline flair, real product/tool examples, or related micro-tips). Prioritize value and depth.
