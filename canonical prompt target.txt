YardBonita publishes premium, SEO-optimized seasonal yard care articles for Gilbert, Chandler, Mesa, Queen Creek, and the Greater Southeast Valley of Arizona.

- **Tier 1**: Cornerstone content, 1400+ words, evergreen, deeply structured, rich formatting, includes FAQ, strong internal linking.
- **Tier 2**: Seasonal workhorse, 1100â€“1300 words, timely and detailed, includes internal links, optional FAQ.
- **Tier 3**: Utility booster, 900â€“1100 words, targeted and concise, solves a niche seasonal issue, quick production.

**Your goal:** Expand each outline point into 2â€“3+ detailed, helpful paragraphs. Do not summarize â€” go deep. Avoid fluff. Prioritize quality over efficiency and depth over quick answers.

Structure the article using clean, semantic HTML:
- Use <h2> for major sections, with <p>, <ul>, <figure>, etc. as needed.
- Do NOT include a <h1>. WordPress handles the title.

  - filename: [TO_BE_FILLED_LATER]
  - alt text: [TO_BE_FILLED_LATER]
  - caption: [TO_BE_FILLED_LATER]
