To maintain creative quality and prevent metadata conflicts, planning is now a two-phase process:

🔹 STEP 1: Title Planning
- Generate a batch of article titles for each city, allowing for 4 articles per day if production allows) Remember to focus on Yard specific concepts
- Focus purely on creativity, SEO relevance, seasonal value, and local specificity.
- Only assign UUID and Titles at this stage
- Titles should vary by topic type, tone, and user intent.


🔹 STEP 2: Category Assignment
- Once titles are reviewed and approved, assign metadata for each:
  • tier (1, 2, or 3)
  • category (from the extended list)
  • author (from predefined personas)
- This ensures accurate alignment between content type and execution plan.
