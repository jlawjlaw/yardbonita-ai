🎯 GOAL: Generate compelling, search-optimized article titles for a local yard and garden content site (YardBonita.com), focused entirely on Gilbert, AZ.

Each title should:
• Reflect real homeowner needs, concerns, or seasonal goals
• Be hyper-relevant to the Gilbert desert climate (Zone 9b)
• Avoid general filler — be useful, timely, or spark curiosity
• Sound human — like something you'd click or search
• Be optimized for organic Google search, without being keyword-stuffed
• NOT include the city name unless natural — most titles will live on city-specific pages

🎨 Style & Variety Rules:

• Vary tone and format — mix questions, how-tos, bold claims, data-backed lists, etc.
• Focus on what would make a busy homeowner stop scrolling

🏆 Site Strategy:
• YardBonita earns revenue via Google AdSense and grows via organic search
• Long-term goal: 4 posts per day, 365/year, across topics like lawn care, watering, DIY landscaping, pest control, native planting, and home efficiency
• This is a one-person operation: efficiency matters, but **quality and SEO impact are top priority**

✅ Example Great Titles:
• “What to Plant in Gilbert Before the Monsoons Hit”
• “Why Your Drip System Keeps Failing — And How to Fix It Fast”
• “Desert Lawn Rescue: Bring Back Bermuda Grass in 3 Weeks”
• “5 Gilbert Yard Mistakes That Waste Water (And Money)”
• “This $30 Soil Fix Changed My Entire Front Yard”

Each new title will be assigned to the first future calendar date in `2025planning.xlsx` with fewer than 4 articles, marked with a `status` of `planned`.

Avoid writing generic category-based titles like “Smart Seasonal Tips for Lawn Care.” Instead, generate standout articles that **solve problems**, **spark interest**, or **target high-intent queries**.

✅ Title Generation Rules (as clarified):
	•	No internal title pool: I will not reuse or draw from a static list of templates.
	•	No duplicate checking: Repetition is allowed if it happens naturally across time.
	•	Full creativity: Every title will be generated fresh using:
	•	The Title Creation Prompt you uploaded
	•	The site’s overall tone and mission (high-quality, helpful, SEO-smart seasonal yard advice for Gilbert, AZ)
	•	Context from the current 2025planning.xlsx
