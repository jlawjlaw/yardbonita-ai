yes, please print canonical scripts

✅ Canonical Lock Protocol for YardBonita Scripts
(utils.py + generate_article.py)
Last Confirmed Version: Canonical v1.0.7

This protocol governs the locked development, synchronization, and print-handling of utils.py and generate_article.py for YardBonita. It prevents regression, feature loss, or accidental overwrites by ensuring all work is version-controlled, print-confirmed, and traceable at the function level.

🔐 Canonical Lock System: How It Works

Once you say “yes, please print canonical scripts”, the following rules are permanently active unless explicitly revoked:

1. Both Scripts Are Always Printed Together
	•	utils.py and generate_article.py are treated as a single locked unit.
	•	They are always printed back-to-back in the same response — no second confirmation needed.

2. Canonical Headers Are Embedded

Each script must begin with a standardized version header that includes:
	•	✅ Script name and purpose
	•	✅ Canonical Version number (e.g., Canonical v1.0.7)
	•	✅ Last Modified date
	•	✅ Full list of current supported features, not just recent changes
	•	✅ Function-Level Index listing each major function and its purpose
	•	✅ Most recent changes in a separate “🆕 Recent Changes” block (required)

3. Version Safety and Alignment Are Enforced
	•	Both scripts must carry the exact same canonical version number.
	•	Any modification to one will trigger reprinting of both to maintain integrity.

⚠️ Development Ground Rules (Under Lock)
	•	❌ No previously working feature may be removed, rewritten, or skipped unless:
	•	You explicitly request the change, or
	•	I inform you beforehand and you approve it.
	•	🛡️ The following features must remain intact and functional:
	•	Flair systems and persona tone integration
	•	“About the Author” auto-appending logic (for Tier 1 and 2)
	•	Internal and rela ted link logic (with fallback <ul> if no inline links)
	•	DALL·E image generation (with fallback filename/metadata when needed)
	•	Internal placeholder cleanup (e.g., [INTERNAL LINK])
	•	Clean HTML structure (no <h1> inside <body>)
	•	🧪 Scripts run in test mode only — no writes to spreadsheet unless explicitly unlocked

🧠 Memory + Regression Protection Strategy

Memory cannot persist between sessions. To recover state immediately in any future session, paste:

“Apply Canonical Lock Protocol and resume with latest confirmed version.”

When you do:
	•	I will resume using the last known locked version of both scripts (you may paste them if needed).
	•	I will not infer, guess, or silently rewrite any logic from memory.
	•	I will enforce function-level diffing, version headers, and feature protection automatically.
